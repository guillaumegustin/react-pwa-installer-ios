# react-pwa-installer-ios

This simple utils React component allows you to easily display a POPUP for your iOS users, informing that he/she can install the app on the phone.
This component integrate the following logic:
- The popup will display only on iOS device, not in standalone mode
- When the user clicks anywhere, the popup is closed
- When the popup is closed, timestamp is stored in localstorage. Pop up won't open for the next 10 days.

      Hey ! I am the PwaInstallPopupIOS component.
      without the 'force=true' props, I will display only on iOS device,
      not in standalone mode.
    </div>
  </PwaInstallPopupIOS>
```
